## How Does It Work? üåü

**MicroStream** simplifies communication between microservices using a **centralized hub-and-spoke architecture**, also known as a **star network**. In this model, the **[MicroStream Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** acts as the central communication point, and your microservices, equipped with the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**, connect to the Hub and communicate through it.

Here's how it works:

### üåü The Star Network Concept

Imagine a star:

- The **center of the star** is the **[MicroStream Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
- The **points of the star** are your **microservices** (each equipped with the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**).

![MicroStream Star Network Diagram](https://mermaid.ink/svg/eyJjb2RlIjoiZ3JhcGggVERcbiAgICBIdWJbTWljcm9TdHJlYW0gSHViXSAtLT4gU2VydmljZTFbU2VydmljZSAxXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTJbU2VydmljZSAyXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTNbU2VydmljZSAzXVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTRbU2VydmljZSA0XVxuICAgIEh1YiAtLT4gU2VydmljZTVbU2VydmljZSA1XVxuIiwibWVybWFpZCI6eyJ0aGVtZSI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJsaW5lV2lkdGgiOiIzIn19)

In this setup:

- The **Hub** acts as the central communication point.
- **Services** (nodes) connect to the Hub and communicate through it, **not directly with each other**.

### üöÄ How It Works in Practice

1. **Service Registration**:

   - Each microservice connects to the Hub using the **[MicroStream Client](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-client)**.
   - The **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** automatically detects and registers the service.

2. **Request-Response Communication in Real-Time**:

   - When **Service A** needs to talk to **Service B**, it sends a request to the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
   - The **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** routes the request to **Service B**.
   - **Service B** processes the request and sends a response back through the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)**.
   - All communication happens in **real-time** over WebSockets, ensuring fast and reliable data exchange.

3. **Auto-Discovery**:

   - Once connected, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** keeps track of all connected services, so you don‚Äôt need to manually configure connections between services. However, you still need to specify the target service and method when sending a request.

4. **Heartbeat Mechanism**:
   - Services send regular "heartbeats" to the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** to confirm they‚Äôre active.
   - If a service stops sending heartbeats, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** removes it from the network.

### ‚ú® Why Choose MicroStream?

**MicroStream** is designed to make microservice communication **simple**, **efficient**, and **scalable**. Here‚Äôs why you‚Äôll love it:

- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration required to get started.
- **Real-Time Request-Response Communication**: Built on WebSockets for instant, reliable data exchange.
- **Auto-Service-Management**: Once connected, the **[Hub](https://github.com/arijitcodes/microstream-hub)** keeps track of all services, simplifying network management.
- **Scalable**: Easily add more services without reconfiguring the network.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional REST or gRPC.
- **Flexible**: Works seamlessly with any microservice architecture.

## Deployment üöÄ

### Running via Docker üê≥

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To change the port in Docker Compose, you can set the `PORT` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  microstream-hub:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-3000}:3000"
    environment:
      - PORT=3000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Running Locally üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

```bash
npm install
```

#### Running the Hub

```bash
node src/hub.js
```

#### Configuration Example

To change the port, you can set the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=4000 node src/hub.js
```
